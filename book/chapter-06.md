Tasks in Rust
=============

One of the things that Rust is super good at is concurrency. In order to
understand Rust's strengths, you have to understand its approach to
concurrency, and then its approach to memory. The two are inter-related,
and we can't keep glossing over details like "just put `~` in front of
things" anymore.

Tasks
-----

The fundamental unit of computation in Rust is called a 'task.' Tasks
are similar to 'lightweight' threads in Erlang or Go. Rust tasks are
entirely isolated from one another, though. They're scheduled on an M:N
basis to OS threads, so they're not quite green threads exactly, either:
they'll be parallel as well as concurrent. There can be 200k Rust tasks
running on 4 OS threads (the rust scheduler by default uses one thread
per core on your computer).

As a Rubyist, you probably don't know anything about that, so let's talk
code first, and get into what exactly all that means later. Here's some
code that prints "Hello" 100 times:

~~~ {.rust}
    fn main() {
        do 100.times {
            println("Hello");
        }
    }
~~~

You may remember this from earlier. This loops 100 times, printing
"Hello." Now let's make it roflscale with tasks:

~~~ {.rust}
    fn main() {
        do 100.times {
            do spawn {
                println("Hello");
            }
        }
    }
~~~

That's it! We spin up 100 tasks that print stuff. If you inspect your
output, you can tell it's working:

    Hello
    HelloHello

    Hello

Ha! Printing to the screen is obviously something that tasks can step
over each other with (if you're curious, it's because it is printing the
string and the newline separately. Sometimes, another task gets to print
its string before this task prints its newline). But the vast majority
of things aren't like that. Let's take a look at the type signature of
`spawn`:

~~~ {.rust}
    fn spawn(f: ~fn())
~~~

Spawn is a function that takes a pointer to another function (it's a
higher order function). But there's that `~` again. This means that the
pointer is an 'owned pointer.' We'll talk more about what exactly that
means in the next chapter, but you can infer from the name that this
means that we own all of the references to the data in this closure.
Therefore, Rust can move the function around at will and know it won't
break anything. The type system has helped us determine exactly how
isolated our task actually is.

Pipes, Channels, and Ports
--------------------------

If our tasks are 100% isolated, they wouldn't be that useful: we need
some kind of communication between tasks in order to get back useful
results. We can communicate between tasks with pipes. Pipes have two
ends: a channel that sends info down the pipe, and a port that receives
info. Here's an example of a task that sends us back a 10:

~~~ {.rust}
    fn main() {
        let (port, chan): (Port<int>, Chan<int>) = stream();

        do spawn {
            chan.send(10);
        }

        println(port.recv().to_str());
    }
~~~

You can imagine that instead of sending 10, we might be doing some sort
of complex calculation. It could be doing that work in the background
while we did more important things.

What about that `chan.send` bit? Well, the task captures the `chan`
variable we set up before, so it's just matter of using it. This is
similar to Ruby's blocks:

~~~ {.ruby}
    foo = 10
    2.times do
      puts foo
    end
~~~

This is really only one-way transit, though: what if we want to
communicate back and forth? Setting up two ports and channels each time
would be pretty annoying, so we have some standard library code for
this: `DuplexStream`:

~~~ {.rust}
    extern mod extra;
    use extra::comm::DuplexStream;

    fn plus_one(channel: &DuplexStream<int, int>) {
        let mut value: int;
        loop {
            value = channel.recv();
            channel.send(value + 1);
        }
    }

    fn main() {
        let (from_child, to_child) = DuplexStream();

        do spawn {
            plus_one(&to_child);
        }

        from_child.try_send(22);
        from_child.try_send(23);
        from_child.send(24);
        from_child.send(25);

        do 4.times {
            let answer = from_child.recv();
            println(answer.to_str());
        }
    }
~~~


What's this `extern mod extra` madness? Well, that's how we `link` to
external libraries. If you've used C or C++ before, you know what this
means. If you haven't, it's essentially how you declare that your
program uses a certain dynamic library (`.dll` on Windows, `.dylib` on
OS X, and `.so` on other Unix systems). `extra` is part of Rust itself,
it includes extras as compared to `std` (which is automatically included
in every program), such as JSON parsing, networking, and data
structures. See <http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/0.8/extra/index.html>
for more.

We make a function that just loops forever, gets an `int` off of the
port, and sends the number plus 1 back down the channel. In the main
function, we make a `DuplexStream`, send one end to a new task, and then
send it a `22`, and print out the result. Because this task is running
in the background, we can send it bunches of values:

~~~ {.rust}
    fn main() {
        let (from_child, to_child) = DuplexStream();

        do spawn {
            plus_one(&to_child);
        };

        from_child.send(22);
        from_child.send(23);
        from_child.send(24);
        from_child.send(25);

        do 4.times {
            let answer = from_child.recv();
            println(answer.to_str());
        }
    }
~~~

Pretty simple. Our task is always waiting for work. If you run this,
you'll get some weird output at the end:

    $ rust run tasks.rs
    23
    24
    25
    26
    task <unnamed> failed at 'receiving on closed channel', /home/steveklabnik/src/rust/src/libstd/rt/comm.rs:487


`task failed at 'receiving on closed channel'`. Basically, we quit the program
without closing our child task, and so it died when our main task (the one
running `main`) died. By default, Rust tasks are bidirectionally linked, which
means if one task fails, all of its children and parents fail too. We can fix
this for now by telling our child to die:

~~~ {.rust}
    extern mod extra;
    use extra::comm::DuplexStream;

    fn plus_one(channel: &DuplexStream<int, int>) {
        let mut value: int;
        loop {
            value = channel.recv();
            channel.send(value + 1);
            if value == 0 { break; }
        }
    }

    fn main() {
      let (from_child, to_child) = DuplexStream();

      do spawn {
          plus_one(&to_child);
      };

      from_child.send(22);
      from_child.send(23);
      from_child.send(24);
      from_child.send(25);
      from_child.send(0);

      do 4.times {
          let answer = from_child.recv();
          println(answer.to_str());
      }
    }
~~~

Now when we send a zero, our child task terminates. If you run this,
you'll get no errors at the end. We can also change our failure mode.
Rust also provides unidirectional and unlinked failure modes as well,
but I don't want to talk about them right now. This would give you
patterns like "Spin up a management task that is bidirectionally linked
to main, but have it spin up children who are unlinked." Neato.

Rust tasks are so lightweight that you can conceivably spin up a ton of
tasks, maybe even one per entity in your system.
[Servo](https://github.com/mozilla/servo) is a prototype browser
rendering engine from Mozilla, and it spins up a **ton** of tasks.
Parallel rendering, parsing, downloading, everything.

I'm imagining that most production Rust programs will eventually have a
main that spins up some sort of global task setup, and all the work gets
done inside these tasks that communicate with each other. Like, for a
video game:

~~~ {.rust}
    fn main() {

      do spawn {
        player_handler();
      }

      do spawn {
        world_handler();
      }

      do spawn {
        rendering_handler();
      }

      do spawn {
        io_handler();
      }
    }
~~~

... with the associated channels, of course. This feels very Actor-y to
me. I like it. In fact, someone *is* working on an Actor
[library](http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1i3c15/experimental_actor_library_in_rust/)!
We'll see how these kinds of things develop as Rust moves forward. For more,
the [tasks and communication
tutorial](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/0.8/tutorial-tasks.html) is helpful.
