Rust for Rubyists
*****************

Nobody should only learn one programming language. Before Ruby, I wrote things
in C, C++, Java, Perl, PHP, and all sorts of things. I've always said that
I love Ruby, but maybe someday, something would come along that'd be better for
what I was building.

I'm not sure if Rust is that language yet, but it is damn interesting. One of
the worst things about Rust is that there's next to no documentation, though.
So, I decided that as I figured things out, I'd write them out so that you
don't have to suffer the way I did. Maybe 'suffer' is too strong a word; Rust
is worth the hassle, though.

In this book, we'll talk about why you should care about Rust, how to get up
and running, the basics of writing software in Rust, and maybe even something
like building a Ruby gem with Rust.

NOTE: While this book is called "Rust for Rubyists," it should be accessible
to anyone who knows about OOP and programming in a dynamically typed language.
I will make analogies that will make the most sense to Rubyists, but you can
still get a lot out of this book if you are a programmer of a different sort.
If your favorite language is static, then you're already ahead of the game.
You can just disregard a lot of the analogies.
