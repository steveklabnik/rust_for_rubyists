          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
          <h4>Who are you?</h4>
          <p>I'm <strong>Steve Klabnik</strong>, and I've been a Rubyist for years now. I'm a <a href="http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/steve-klabnik/commits">Rails committer</a>, instructor with <a href="http://www.jumpstartlab.com/about/">Jumpstart Lab</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/steveklabnik">prolific Open Source contributor</a>.</p>
          <p>I love new programming languages, and while I've been using Ruby for the past few years, I've coded in C, Java, PHP, Haskell, and a host of others. I also love writing, and good documentation, which is hard to find. Rust doesn't have a lot of that yet, so I'm pitching in!</p>

          <h4>Why Rust?</h4>
          <p><a href="book/book.html#why-care-about-rust">The first section of the book discusses this</a>, but basically, Rust is good at everything Ruby is bad at. I like learning new things, but if I'm gonna put the time in, I want it to expand my mind.</p>
          <p>I can tell you I already understand more about concurrency, even after working with Rust for a week.</p>
          <p>Rust also interests me because it's a safe systems programming langauge, and those historically have been some of the most unsafe. No null pointers, pattern matching, and lambda expressions are some of my favorite language features, and Rust has them all!</p>

          <h4>What am I buying?</h4>
          <p>Basically, you can <a href="book/index.html">read the whole thing online for free</a> if you'd like, or you can <a href="buy.html">buy a copy</a> in PDF or MOBI. Like anyone else, I have bills to pay, so I think this is fair: you can read the full content in a browser, or you can give me some money and check it out on your e-reader.</p>
          <p>The contents of the two are exactly the same: I generate them both from the same source.</p>

          <h4>Do I have to know Ruby?</h4>
          <p>Really, I love alliteration: the only thing the 'for Rubyists' really means is that I assume you don't know about pointers, concurrency, or similar things. If you program in another dynamically typed language, you'll be just fine. If you program in another systems language, you'll be more than fine.</p>
